- This project can be run on cpu or nvidia gpu, but we recommend using gpu to train it.
- We use the dataset "CelebA" to train model. please download it first from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
- Please crop the images to 128*128. We recommend to use this project [HD-CelebA-Cropper](https://github.com/LynnHo/HD-CelebA-Cropper).
